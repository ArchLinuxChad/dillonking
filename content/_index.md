# Website about GNU/Linux and my GNU/Life
Hello, welcome to my website. Here I make posts about one of my favourite things, Linux.

# My problems with Modern Society and Life
I also talk about the problems I have with how modern society runs and works.

# Politics
Every now and then I like to talk about Politics.

# FOSS Movement
I am a big supporter of the Free and Open Source Software Movement. This is because I believe that everyone should have a right to online privacy and should be able to view and modify the source code of the apps they use.

This is why I am a member of [Free Software Foundation](https://fsf.org)
