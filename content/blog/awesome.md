Recently I have switches from herbstluftwm to using awesomewm. 

# Why Did I Switch
I switched because herbstluftwm is a manual tiler meaning you have to choose were the next window is going to spawn, but I wanted to move to a dynamic tiler. A dynamic tiler spawns your new window into a position which is predefined by a layout, this means you can just open windows and not worry about where they are going to tile.

# Why Did I choose Awesomewm
I chose awesome because it has:
- Sensible Key Binds
- Can launch apps when it launches
- Has a nice default Bar with a System Tray

# My Setup
I am pretty much running stock awesome. The only differences are:
- Systray moved to left of keyboard layout indicator
- text size and font
- size of wibar
- Different Keybinds
- Some layouts removed

# My Config

Note: Some of the keybinds will not work because they call some of my custom shell scripts.
